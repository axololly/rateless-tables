# `rateless_tables`

This is a translation of [`riblt`](https://github.com/yangl1996/riblt/), made to fit my own needs. All the other crates sucked.

This is **not** intended for regular use, and is just for my [version control system](https://github.com/axololly/vcs). Therefore, documentation doesn't exist.
